GPS Timestamp corrector for iNAV Blackbox gpx tracks
====================================================

The problem with Blackbox exported GPX tracks is that the
Blackbox logs dont contain an absolute timestamp but only
relative timestamps to boot of the flight controller.

So when using 

    blackbox_decode LOG00013.TXT

from the [cleanflight blackbox-tools](https://github.com/cleanflight/blackbox-tools) you will get
an gpx track with mapped timestamps to 2000-01-01 + uptime.

    <trkpt lat="51.8860612" lon="8.3251832"><ele>66</ele><time>2000-01-01T00:03:03.579096Z</time></trkpt>
    <trkpt lat="51.8860612" lon="8.3251832"><ele>66</ele><time>2000-01-01T00:03:03.609124Z</time></trkpt>

These are not usable for tagging pictures/aerials with [gpscorrelate](http://freefoote.dview.net/linux/gpscorrelate).

Using the `correctgps` from this repo the timestamps will be corrected to the absolute timestamp. For
this the iNAV Blackbox log needs to contain an absolute timestamp in the ASCII header which will most likely
be the case when the GPS/FC had a lock when arming:

    [...]
    H Field S encoding:1,1,7,7,7,1
    H Firmware type:Cleanflight
    H Firmware revision:INAV 1.9.1 (03a5c1922) OMNIBUSF4PRO_LEDSTRIPM5
    H Firmware date:Apr 21 2018 13:15:03
    H Log start datetime:2018-06-16T13:10:49.264+00:00
    H Craft name:
    H P interval:1/1
    [ ... ]

The full run to tag images would be:

    blackbox_decode LOG00013.TXT     
    correctgpx LOG00013.TXT LOG00013.01.gps.gpx LOG00013.01.gps.corrected.gpx
    gpscorrelate -z +2 -O +36 -v -g LOG00013.01.gps.corrected.gpx *.JPG

Where `LOG00013.TXT` would be your flight controllers blackbox file. 
With this call `gpscorrelate` is configured for a timezone offset of +2 Hours
which is CEST and 36 Seconds time offset for the camera. To get the Camera offset
you should let the camera take a picture of an GPS Receiver before or directly
after flight. Difference between the cameras exif meta tags and the visually seen
time is your offset.
